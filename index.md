This is the course page
for the seminar course
_Figurative Langauge and Natural Language Processing_
at the [Department of Linguistics](http://sfs.uni-tuebingen.de),
[University of Tübingen](http://uni-tuebingen.de).

Detecting, understanding and generating figurative language
have been one of the biggest challenges
for natural language processing systems.
In this seminar course, after introductory lectures
during the first few weeks, participants are required to read, discuss
and present selected papers from literature. The course also includes
some hands-on demonstrations of the issues regarding
figurative language processing in NLP.

The normal course work is worth 6ECTS. It is possible to obtain 9ECTS
with additional work (typically a term paper).

## Requirements

Earlier machine learning exposure is essential for success in this
course. Completion of 'Statistical Language Processing' or similar
course work or experience is required.
